<h2 class="mb-4 text-3xl font-semibold">What This Is (And What It Isn’t)</h2>

<p class="mb-6 text-lg">Slow And Steady Health is a private studio gym in Dowerglen, Edenvale.</p>

<p class="mb-6">This is not an open gym. You don’t come in and train on your own. Every visit is a coached personal training session, planned and supervised from start to finish.</p>

<p class="mb-6">You’re here to be guided, not left guessing.</p>
</section>


<section class="mb-16">
<h2 class="mb-4 text-3xl font-semibold">One Flat Monthly Fee. Unlimited Coaching.</h2>

<p class="mb-6">For R1,250 total, you get unlimited personal training for the entire month.</p>

<p class="mb-6">There’s no cap on sessions and no generic workouts. Each session is adjusted to your fitness level, your goals, and how your body responds. If you’re new to training, you’ll be coached carefully. If you’re coming back after time off, you’ll rebuild properly.</p>

<p class="mb-6">The focus is steady progress, done safely and consistently.</p>

<section class="mb-16">
<h2 class="mb-4 text-3xl font-semibold">Simple Meal Guidance That Supports Your Training</h2>

<p class="mb-6">Your month includes personalised meal guidance designed to fit your real life.</p>

<p class="mb-6">This isn’t a strict diet or a rigid meal plan. It’s practical guidance that helps you eat in a way that supports your training without taking over your routine.</p>

<p class="mb-6">The goal is habits you can maintain, not rules you’ll eventually ignore.</p>
</section>


<section class="mb-16">
<h2 class="mb-4 text-3xl font-semibold">Bring a Buddy and Make It Easier to Stay Consistent</h2>

<p class="mb-6">You can train with a friend, partner, or family member.</p>

<p class="mb-6">Training together makes it easier to show up and stick with it. It also makes personal training more accessible. When you share the membership, you both receive the same coaching and support, and the cost works out to R625 each for the month.</p>

<p class="mb-6">You train together. You progress together.</p>

<p class="mb-6">There are no crowds, no waiting for equipment, and no feeling watched. The space is quiet, focused, and welcoming, with attention placed entirely on your training.</p>
